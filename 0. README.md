Impact of Data Augmentation on Classification Performance
This project evaluates effects of several data augmentation strategies on Random Forest and Logistic Regression performance in a classification problem with two groups (A and B), where the train and test set sizes for Group A gradually decrease, while those for Group B increase. The models are tested on a simulated dataset with 50 features and subtle mean differences between the groups. In each iteration, models are trained on the adjusted datasets and evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC, and confusion matrices. 
The data augmentation strategies are: a) oversampling of the minority group; b) supplementing Group A with synthetic samples using SMOTE; c) supplementing Group A with synthetic samples using ROSE; and d) replacing both groups with ROSE-generated synthetic data starting from the second configuration when the class ratio shifts from 50:50.  
Results highlight how different augmentation methods impact classification performance, with the complete replacement with ROSE-generated samples proving most effective.
